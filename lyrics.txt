rnIn the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man,
Now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can.
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam.

[Chorus:]
Good Times, Bad Times, you know I've had my share;
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man,
Well, I still don't seem to care.

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be,
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me.
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end,
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oooh.

Hear the wind whisper in the trees telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me.

Well, if the sun shines so bright, or our way is darkest night,
The road we choose is always right, so fine.
Ah, can a love be so strong when so many loves go wrong?
Will our love go on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on?

As we walk down a country lane, while singing a song,
Hear me calling your name.
Hear the wind whisper in the trees, telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me.

Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed merle.
Come on now, well let me tell you
What you're missing, messing round them brick walls.

So of one thing I am sure, it's a friendship so pure,
Angels singing all around my door so fine.

You're the finest dog I knew so fine.

When you're old and your eyes are dim there ain't no old shep gonna happen again.
We'll still go walking down country lanes, I'll sing the same old song,
Hear me call your name.nrnWhen I done quit hollerin' baby, I believe I'll shake 'em on down.

It's been a long time, been a long time, been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

Yes, it has.

It's been a long time since the book of love.
I can't count the tears of a life with no love.
Carry me back, carry me back, carry me back, baby, where I come from.

It's been a long time, been a long time, been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight,
Making vows that just can't work right.
Open your arms, open your arms, open your arms, baby, let my love come running in.

It's been a long time, been a long time, been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

It's been a long time, been a long time, been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.nrnThe Queen of Light took her bow,
And then she turned to go,
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom,
And walked the night alone.

Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The dark Lord rides in force tonight,
And time will tell us all.

Oh, throw down your plow and hoe,
Rest not to lock your homes.
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all.

I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below,
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow.

The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness,
The ground is rich from tender care,
Repay, do not forget, no, no.

Dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The apples turn to brown and black,
The tyrant's face is red.

Oh war is the common cry,
Pick up your swords and fly.
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know.

Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow,
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.

The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath,
The drums will shake the castle wall,
The Ringwraiths ride in black, ride on.

Sing as you raise your bow,
(Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before.
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold.

Oh dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back.
Bring it back.

At last the sun is shining,
The clouds of blue roll by,
With flames from the dragon of darkness,
The sunlight blinds his eyes.

Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back,
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

Oh now oh now oh now oh, oh now oh now oh now
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Oh now oh now oh now oh, oh now oh now oh now
Bring it bring it bring it bring it bring itnrnThere's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who stand looking.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.nrnWalkin' in the park just the other day, Baby, 
rnWhat do you, what do you think I saw?

Got to try to find a way, 
Got to try to get away,
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, babe.

Oh, baby, the river's red, 
Oh, baby, in my head.
There's a funny feelin' goin' on. 
I don't think I can hold out long.

And when the owls cry in the night, 
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry,
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel? 
If the rivers run dry, baby, how would you feel?

Craze, baby, the rainbow's end, 
Mm, baby, it's just a den
For those who hide, 
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe.

And when the owls cry in the night, 
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry,
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel? 
If the rivers run dry, baby, how do you feel?

Ooh yeah, brave I endure.
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore.
They can't hold the wrath of those who walk,
And the boots of those who march,
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago.nrnSpent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart

Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let them tell you that they're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today

Mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun begin to awake
Watch out

Seems that the wrath
Of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose
And it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line
If I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there
Where the path runs straight
And high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in the mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seemsnrnIf it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay

Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well

Don't it make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home
You don't know which way to go?
If you're goin' down south
Then there's no work to do
If you re goin' north there's Chicago

Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good
Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move

All last night I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
Thinkin' about my baby and my happy home

Going, I'm going to Chicago
Going to Chicago

rnCity lights are oh so bright, as we go sliding... sliding... sliding through.nrnIt is the springtime of my loving - the second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing - so little warmth I've felt before.
It isn't hard to feel me glowing - I watched the fire that grew so low.

It is the summer of my smiles - flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.
Speak to me only with your eyes. It is to you I give this tune.
Ain't so hard to recognize - These things are clear to all from time to time.

Talk, talk, talk, talk - I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go. I cursed the gloom that set upon us, 'pon us, 'pon us...
But I know that I love you so. But I know that I love you so

These are the seasons of emotion and like the wind they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion - I see the torch we all must hold.
This is the mystery of the quotient, quotient - Upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall.
It's just a little rain oh yeahnrnHey, lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough.
Oh, darling, darling, darling, walk a while with me
You've got so much, so much, so much.

Many have I loved
Many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed
Along the open road.

Many times I've lied
Many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered
How much there is to know.

Many dreams come true
And some have silver linings
I live for my dream
And a pocketful of gold.

Mellow is a man
Who knows what he's been missing
Many many men
Can't see the open road.

Many is a word

Guessing 'bout a thing

The winds of Thor are blowing cold. 

They're wearing steel that's bright and true.
They carry news that must get through.

They choose the path where no-one goes. 

They hold no quarter. 
They hold no quarter.

Walking side by side with death,
The devil mocks their every step

To build a dream for me and you.

They choose the path where no-one goes.

Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball.

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for free, I play for me and play a whole lot more, more!
Singing about the good things and the sun that lights the day

I don't know.

Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing about the mountains but the mountains washed away

From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go.
From the door comes Satan's daughter.
And it only goes to show.
And you know.

There's an angel on my shoulder.
In my hand a sword of gold.
Let me wander in your garden.
And the seeds of love I'll sow.
You know.

So the world is spinning faster.
Are you dizzy when you stall?
Let the music be your master.
Will you heed the master's call?

Satan and man.

Said there ain't no use in crying
'Cause it will only, only drive you mad.
Does it hurt to hear them lying?
Was this the only world you had?

So let me take you, take you to the movie.
Can I take you, baby, to the show?
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly?
Can I make your garden grow?
You know that's right.nrnGreasy slicked down body, groovy leather trim

With stars to fill my dream
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been

Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
And all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear

Ooh, baby, I've been flying
No, yeah, mama, there ain't no denyin'
Ooh, yeah, I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'

All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Heed the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream

My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

When I'm on, when I'm on my way
When I see, when I see the way, you stay

When I'm down
When I'm down, so down

And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea

Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays
On the wings of maybe, downy birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
But as the eagle leaves the nest, got so far to go

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be

Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad?
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had?

Do you ever remember me, baby,
Did it feel so good?
'Cause it was just the first time,
And you knew you would

Dewy eyes now sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul

And as I turned to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?

With all the fun to have, to live the dreams we always had
Whoa, the songs to sing when we at last return again

Sending off a glancing kiss to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil is in his hole

Oh to sail away to sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream, hides inside and never seen

Into the sun the south the north, at last the birds have flown
The shackles of commitments fell in pieces on the ground

Oh to ride the wind, to tread the air above the din
Oh to laugh aloud, dancing as we fought the crowd

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone

If one bell should ring in celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat as proud the head with heavy feet

Days went by when you and I bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant our mutual child did grow

Oh the sweet refrain soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again

Wondering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth

The mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

Oh the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earthnrnYou said I was the only, With my lemon in your hand

rnNo other love could be so strong 
rnShe locked up my heart in her bottom drawer 
rnNow she took my heart she took my keys 
rnFrom in my old blue dungarees 
rnAnd I'll never go to Texas anymore 
rn
rn[Chorus:] Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
rnShe took my love and walked right out the door 
rnAnd if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
rnI'm gonna give her something like she never had before 
rn
rnI took her love at seventeen 
rnA little late these days it seems 
rnBut they said heaven is well worth waiting for 
rnI took her word I took it all 
rnBeneath the sign that said &quot;U-haul&quot; 
rnShe left angels hangin round for more 
rn
rn
rn
rnI thought I had it all sewn up 
rnOur love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
rnBut folks said she was after something more 
rnI never did quite understand 
rnAll that talk about rockin' bands 
rnBut they just rolled my doll right out the door 
rnOh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door!nrnSisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace, 
rnAwait their place within the ring of calm; 
rnStill stand to turn in seconds of release, 
rnAwait the call they know may never come. 
rnIn times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
rnTo jeopardize the course, upset the run; 
rnAnd all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
rnAs love in the halls of plenty overrun. 
rn
rnStill in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast, 
rnUnending dances shadowed on the day. 
rnWithin their walls, their daunting formless keep, 
rnPreserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay. 
rnFaceless legions stood in readiness to weep, 
rnJust turn a coin, bring order to the fray; 
rnAnd everything is soon no sooner thought than deed, 
rnBut no one seemed to question in anyway. 
rn
rnHow keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
rnTo seek the unsuspecting and the weak; 
rnAnd powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
rnToward the foe that threatened from the deep. 
rnWho cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
rnAdrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
rnAnd to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
rnWhere was your word, where did you go? 
rnWhere was your helping, where was your bow? Bow. 
rnDull is the armour, cold is the day. 
rnHard was the journey, dark was the way. Way. 
rnI heard the word; I couldn't stay. Oh. 
rnI couldn't stand it another day, another day, 
rnAnother day, another day. 
rn
rnTouched by the timely coming, 
rnRoused from the keeper's sleep, 
rnRelease the grip, throw down the key. 
rn
rnHeld now within the knowing, 
rnRest now within the peace. 
rnTake of the fruit, but guard the seed. 
rn
rnThey had to stay! 
rn
rnHeld now within the knowing, 
rnRest now within the beat. 
rnTake of the fruit, but guard the seed...nrnShould I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you now

The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you child

Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you now
All of my love, oh, yes
All of my love to you now
